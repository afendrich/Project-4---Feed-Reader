# Project 4 --- Feed Reader Testing

This is the fourth project in the Front End Web Development Nanodegeree by Udacity.


## Description

A site was already created and downloaded for use. Commented out in the javascript files were tests to be created for Jasmine to analyze. Detailed instructions are listed below.


## Viewing & using the app

All files are located in the "Project-4---Feed-Reader" directory. Copy all files & folders to your local machine, and open the "index.html" file to open the app. The jasmine tests will be shown at the bottom of the page. After modification to any files associated with the project, the jasmine tests will give you a pass or fail if the modifcations broke what we are testing for in the app.


## Included tests for the project.

1. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
2. Write a test that loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
3. Write a new test suite named "The menu".
4. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default. You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how we're performing the hiding/showing of the menu element.
5. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked and does it hide when clicked again.
6. Write a test suite named "Initial Entries".
7. Write a test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.
8. Write a test suite named "New Feed Selection".
9. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
